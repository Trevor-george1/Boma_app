Technologies

Languages and frameworks
Programming language: Python
Framework: Flask
Frontend: HTML, CSS and javascript

Alternative: Javascript(Node.js for backend, React for Frontend)
Trade-off: Using python and flask for backend and bootstrap for frontend offers a clear separation of concerns, allowing for focused development efforts.

Decision: The decision to use Python with Flask and bootstrap was influenced by the ease of use and simplicity of the technologies.
